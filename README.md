## Thoughts!?
- Merge all the enums into 1 file.
	- Or group enums into 1 file.
- Sidebar
	- Transfrom `Sidebar` to use context for props only, prelayout the components.
	- Rename folder 'Sidebar2' to 'Sidebar'.
- Merge 'issueItem' and 'issue' folder.

## Bugs
- ~~'EditSprintForm' does update value, but throw error on doing so~~.
- importing 'primer' from npm as well as CDN !!?
- 'BacklogPage' crashed if no requested items are returned.
- Board
	- Entire page is dragging instead of 'Issue'.

## Todo
- Dashboard
	- ~~Option to leave project.~~
	- ~~Option to delete project.~~
- Roadmap
	- `EpicInfoCard` has no progress to indicate.
- Board
	- ~~Option to Update and Delete issue.~~
- Backlog
	- ~~Option to Update and Delete issue.~~
